            <p>Traditional animation (also known as cel animation) is hand-drawn. It’s how they made classic films like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Sleeping Beauty. Each frame is drawn on a transparent sheet called a cel, with multiple cels layered over a static background to create movement.</p>

            <p>2D Animation is the art of creating movement by combining a sequence of images together in a two-dimensional space. One second of animation is equal to 24 pictures (or frames), but most 2D animation usually only animates every second frame (12 frames total). It's enough to create the illusion of movement without needing to animate all 24 frames. </p>

            <p>3D Animation is the art of bringing digital characters, vehicles, props, and full scenes to life in a virtual 3D space. It’s more mechanical and technical than 2D animations and requires input from other departments to create 3D models and complex character rigs. </p>

            <p>Stop motion is a series of still images filmed or shot sequentially to simulate action.You can create this animation style with real actors, clay figurines, or even toys and other props. The opportunities to use stop motion are only limited by your imagination. </p>
